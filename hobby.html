      <h2>Why Drumming?</h2>
      <p>Drumming has been a passion of mine because it combines physical energy, rhythm, coordination and creativity. It challenges me to improve continually while also being a fun and expressive outlet.</p>

      <h2>What I’ve Learned</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Timing and rhythm: Keeping steady beats under pressure.</li>
        <li>Teamwork: Playing with others improves synchronisation and listening.</li>
        <li>Discipline: Regular practice has helped in my ROTC training and technical studies.</li>
        <li>Creativity: Experimenting with different styles and beats keeps things fresh.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Record and produce a drumming track by end of year.</li>
        <li>Lead a small percussion ensemble in campus or community events.</li>
        <li>Integrate drumming rhythm concepts into personal productivity and learning routines.</li>
      </ul>
